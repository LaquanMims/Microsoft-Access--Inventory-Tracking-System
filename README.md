# Microsoft-Access--Inventory-Tracking-System

In this project, I created an inventory tracking system for my current job as an Food server at Arena Food Service Inc. The goal of this project consisted of creating a database system for management to get rid of the excel sheets which were their original way of keeping track of inventory. Within this database application on Microsoft Access, Arena is able to track current inventory, prices of products, transactions and add new inventory as it is purchased from their vendors. They are able to log and track more efficiently as a catering service what their inventory is.
